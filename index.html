Prevention Methods<br/>
Make sure not to use homemade fireworks.<br/>
Never allow young children to play with fireworks.<br/>
Make sure there is adult supervision.<br/>
Never place any part of your body directly over a firework, even when trying to light the fuse.<br/>
Never re-light or pick up fireworks that have not ignited fully.<br/>
Only light one firework at a time.<br/>
Never set fireworks off in metal or glass containers.<br/>
Keep a bucket of water or a garden hose near by and always drench the spent firework in water to prevent fires when throwing them out.<br/>
Brown paper packaged fireworks are made for professional displays and should not be bought by general public.<br/>
Only buy and use fireworks if it is legal in your area. The guildlines can change from city to city so check what the guidelines are for your area.<br/>
Make sure everyone is a safe distance from the display and it is always good to have earmuffs or ear plugs.<br/>
If any injuries do happen, call 911 immediately.
